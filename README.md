# GoogleHashCode2020

My solution to the Google Hash Code 2020 problem


## Introduction

Books allow us to discover fantasy worlds and be􀇊er understand the world we l ive i n.
They enable us to l earn about everything from photography to compilers… and of
course a good book is a great way to relax!
Google Books i s a project that embraces the value books bring to our daily l ives. It
aspires to bring the world's books online and make them accessible to everyone. In the
last 15 years, Google Books has collected digital copies of 40 million books i n more
than 400 l anguages1 , pa􀇈ly by scanning books from l ibraries and publishers all around
the world.
In this competition problem, we will explore the challenges of se􀇊ing up a scanning
process for millions of books stored i n l ibraries around the world and having them
scanned at a scanning facility.

## Task

Given a description of l ibraries and books available, plan which books to scan from
which l ibrary to maximize the total score of all scanned books, taking i nto account that
each library needs to be signed up before it can ship books.
